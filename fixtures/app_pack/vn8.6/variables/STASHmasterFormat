# WARNING: THIS FILE IS NOT YET USED BY THE UMUI:
#
# Changing to use this file also involves changing the data structure
# used to store the STASHmaster data in the UMUI scripts. This would
# therefore involve a lot of changes to check_stash.tcl, stash.tcl etc.
# Until then, changes to the STASHmaster format will require changes
# to read_sm_rec.tcl and potentially changes to other UMUI STASH 
# scripts involved with checking the values of items

#
# Format files describe format of certain UM control files such as
# ANCILmasters For a given record type EXAMPLErecords, the format file
# should be called:
#   "EXAMPLErecordsFormat".
# Each set of records is subdivided into submodels identified by a
# letter

#   When editing this file, precede comments with the "#" character;
# in the first column. Lines with only whitespace or comments are
# ignored.
#
# Format of STASHmaster follows:
# First line should state number of lines per record:

5

# The standard record format is of the form:
#
#  "1| elementA1 [elA2 [elAn]] | elB1 [elB2 [elBn]] |... eln1|"
#  "2| element [element2 [elementn]] | element1 [element2 [elementn]] |"
#  "...
#  "n| element [element2 [elementn]] | element1 [element2 [elementn]] |"
#
# That is, each line starts with a line number 0-9 followed by a "|" and
# ends with a |. In between there are one or more fields delimited by "|"
# characters. Each field contains 1 or more elements.

# The purpose of the first part of the format definition is purely to define
# the positions of the "|" characters. To do this, include below an example
# of a well-formed entry in which the bars are positioned as required and
# in which the line numbers are correct. The fields between the bars can
# contain anything, but using a real example is a good reminder of what
# each field means

1|    1 |    0 |    2 |U COMPNT OF WIND AFTER TIMESTEP     |
2|    2 |    0 |    1 |   18 |    1 |    1 |    2 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |
3| 000000000000010000000000000000 | 00000000000000000001 |    1 |

5|    0 |   56 |    0 |   65 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    5 |
#
# The purpose of the second part of the format is to define unique
# identities for each of the elements in each of the fields. One line
# is required for each line in the record. The line contains one item
# for each field.  Where a field requires more than one element, the
# item will consist of a list of sub-items surrounded by {}. For
# example, if a line from an example record comprises the following:
#
# 1| 1 | 2  | 121 | 111 112 113 | title of record |
#
#   the following set of identities would be suitable
#
# main1 main2 field1 {subField1 subField2 subField3} title
#
# The field identities for the UMUI STASHmaster follow

# Each record should have a unique key comprising one or more of the
# above listed fields. The value of a key is required to obtain other
# fields in the record. For example, in the example above, if the key
# were "main1 main2" then each record for each submodel will have a
# unique "main1 main2" combination. If main1=1 and main2=2 and
# submodel is "A", then to access the value of subField2 for this
# record, something like the following will do:
#
# set sf2 [getRecordElement "EXAMPLErecords" "A" 1,2 subField2]
        
sec item

# Define the key for the end of file marker. This is a list of values
# of the key items in the line above that define the final record of
# the file. Typically, if the key were "main1 main2", the EOF marker
# might be "-1 -1". The last record in each and every record file must
# have these values set in the key fields

-1 -1
