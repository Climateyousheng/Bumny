# Format files describe format of certain UM control files such as
# ANCILmasters For a given record type EXAMPLErecords, the format file
# should be called:
#   "EXAMPLErecordsFormat".
# Each set of records is subdivided into submodels identified by a
# letter

#   When editing this file, precede comments with the "#" character;
# in the first column. Lines with only whitespace or comments are
# ignored.
#
# Format of ANCILFILESmaster follows:
# First line should state number of lines per record:

1

# The standard record format is of the form:
#
#  "1| elementA1 [elA2 [elAn]] | elB1 [elB2 [elBn]] |... eln1|"
#  "2| element [element2 [elementn]] | element1 [element2 [elementn]] |"
#  "...
#  "n| element [element2 [elementn]] | element1 [element2 [elementn]] |"
#
# That is, each line starts with a line number 0-9 followed by a "|" and
# ends with a |. In between there are one or more fields delimited by "|"
# characters. Each field contains 1 or more elements.

# The purpose of the first part of the format definition is purely to
# define the positions of the "|" characters. To do this, include
# below an example of a well-formed entry in which the bars are
# positioned as required and in which the line numbers are
# correct. The fields between the bars can contain anything, but using
# a real example is a good reminder of what each field means

1|    1 |   1 |OZONE   |Ozone                                    |

# The purpose of the second part of the format is to define unique
# identities for each of the elements in each of the fields. One line
# is required for each line in the record. The line contains one item
# for each field.  Where a field requires more than one element, the
# item will consist of a list of sub-items surrounded by {}. For
# example, if a line from an example record comprises the following:
#
# 1| 1 | 2  | 121 | 111 112 113 | title of record |
#
#   the following set of identities would be suitable
#
# main1 main2 field1 {subField1 subField2 subField3} title
#
# The field identities for the UMUI ANCILFILESmaster follow
  
fileNo modelNumber envVar title
  
# Each record should have a unique key comprising one or more of the
# above listed fields. The value of a key is required to obtain other
# fields in the record. For example, in the example above, if the key
# were "main1 main2" then each record for each submodel will have a
# unique "main1 main2" combination. If main1=1 and main2=2 and
# submodel is "A", then to access the value of subField2 for this
# record, something like the following will do:
#
# set sf2 [getRecordElement "EXAMPLErecords" "A" 1,2 subField2]
        
fileNo

# Define the key for the end of file marker. This is a list of values
# of the key items in the line above that define the final record of
# the file. Typically, if the key were "main1 main2", the EOF marker
# might be "-1 -1". The last record in each and every record file must
# have these values set in the key fields

-1
