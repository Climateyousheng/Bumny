The HadCM2 Sulphate Loading file contains Anthropogenic 
(tropospheric) sulphate loading patterns.

It is only required in your dump if you are using the HadCM2
version of the shortware radiation (version 2B) and you have chosen
HadCM2's approximate treatment of sulphate aerosol.

If this is the case and you are starting from a dump that does
not have this field included, you will need to either configure
or update this field.

Typically, you will choose to configure the field.
