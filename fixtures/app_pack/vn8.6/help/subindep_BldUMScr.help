This window allows you to enable your job to just build the UM scripts
when doing a run only job with an existing model executable.
The 'Enable build of UM scripts' is only available to be selected if you
do NOT have compilation enabled elsewhere in the job. i.e. the job must 
be a 'run-only' job. The information below the option button shows you
which models you are using in your job and what their compilation settings
are. You cannot change compilation for individual models from here, and must
visit the appropriate panel under 'Compilation and Modifications' to
do so.
