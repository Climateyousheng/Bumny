This window allows users to specify which STASHmacro to use to provide a
standard set of test diagnostics whose field values can be used to test output
packages. The field values are based on calculations from levels and
latitude/logitude.  

See UMDP D7.

This macro asks STASH to provide diagnostics to the output stream PP2 on unit
62.

Most users will not require such output.
