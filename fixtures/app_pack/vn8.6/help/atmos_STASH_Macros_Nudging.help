The Nudging code requires certain diagnostics to be requested in 
STASH by switching on a macro. 
               
If using the Nudging code, please select the option Nudging Diagnostic macro. 

If the diagnostics are not in STASH when nudging is ON, the model 
will stop with error: 'Nudging diagnostics not requested'.
