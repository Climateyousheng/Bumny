This window allows users to specify which STASHmacro to use to drive the wave 
model. This model is external to the UM but part of the operational suite at the
UKMO.  

This macro asks STASH to provide diagnostics to the output streams 69 and 81 (if
split output is required). Set a split time after the end of the output to avoid
splitting.

Most users will not require such output.
