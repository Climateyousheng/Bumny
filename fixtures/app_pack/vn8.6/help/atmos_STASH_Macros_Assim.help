This window allows users to specify which STASHmacro to use to drive the AC
assimilation scheme.

This macro asks STASH to provide diagnostics that are placed into D1 and are
pulled out using a special TAG by the assimilation code.
It is required if and only if the run is using the AC assimilation scheme.
