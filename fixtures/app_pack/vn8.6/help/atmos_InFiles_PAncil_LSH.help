This window allows users to specify the use of the ancillary files for the mean and
standard deviation of the topographic index.

NOTE If this is the first time you are using this option then you will need to
configure these ancillary files.

These ancillary files are fixed in time.

Fields should be configured when changing (especially higher) resolution or moving
to a new land-sea mask.
