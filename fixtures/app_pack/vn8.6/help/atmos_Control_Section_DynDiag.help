This window allows users to specify which version of the dynamics diagnostics 
code section they want to use.

There is only one, so if you are running an atmospheric model you should choose
it. There is little lost in chosing this and this will avoid unsatisfied
external references that cause a problem on some platforms.

See the basic users guide:
Sections, releases and frozen versions.
