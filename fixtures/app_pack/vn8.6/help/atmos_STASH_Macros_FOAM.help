This window allows users to specify which STASHmacro to use to drive the
external FOAM Ocean model.  

The macro writes FOAM driving fields to Unit 100.

Foam requires all diagnostics from T+6, every 6 hours for global
models, and from T+3 every 3 hours for limited area models. In
addition rainfall diagnostics are required from T+0 as these are
accumulations.

Most users will not require such output.
