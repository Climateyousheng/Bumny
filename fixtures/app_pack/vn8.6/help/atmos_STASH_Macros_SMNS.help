This panel allows the user to switch on fieldsfile output 
to be input to the SURF soil moisture nudging scheme.

The user can decide whether to output some fields on all 
land surface tiles or as a land mean, which requires the 
equivalent switch to be set in the SURF system too.

The nudging macro fields are written to unit 84 (PPSMC).

There are currently two macros in use.
