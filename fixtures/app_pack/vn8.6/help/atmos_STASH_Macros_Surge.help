This window allows users to specify which STASHmacro to use to drive the storm
surge model. This model is external to the UM but part of the operational suite
at UKMO.

This macro asks STASH to provide diagnostics to the output streams 81 and 82 
(if split output is required). Set the split time to a time after the end of 
the output period to avoid splitting.


Most users will not require such output.
