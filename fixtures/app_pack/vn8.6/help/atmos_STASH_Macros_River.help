This window allows users to specify a STASHmacro to use to drive
the Centre of Ecology and Hydrology's (CEH's) River Flow Model (RFM).

The macro writes surface and sub-surface runoff meaned over the RFM's
timestep to unit 103 (RFMOUT).

Because of this, the RFM timestep must be a multiple of the MetUM
timestep. If this is not the case, post-processing of the output
fields will be required.
