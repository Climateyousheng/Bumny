This window allows users to specify a STASHmacro to use for stratospheric 
UARS purposes.  

The macro writes UARS relevant fields to Units 86 and 87.

UARS requests these diagnostics in the first 6 hours output to file UARSOUT1, 
and at T+30 and T+54 to file UARSOUT2.

Most users will not require such output.
