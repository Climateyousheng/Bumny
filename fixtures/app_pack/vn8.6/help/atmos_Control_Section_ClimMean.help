This window allows users to specify which version of the climate mean code
section they want to use.
There is only one, so if you are doing climate meaning you should choose it.
There is little lost in chosing this if you are not doing climate meaning and
this will avoid unsatisfied external references that cause a problem on some
platforms.

See the basic users guide:
Sections, releases and frozen versions.
Climate meaning and related diagnostics.
