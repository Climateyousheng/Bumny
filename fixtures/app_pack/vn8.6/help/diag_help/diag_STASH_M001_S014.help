STASH item specific help for 
(1, 14, 181) "TEMPERATURE INCR: En cor K/Timestep"

Temperature increment from the energy correction.

At present the energy correction increment applied to temperature
is the same at all model levels and at all gridpoints. The diagnostic
is avialable at all model levels mainly for checking purposes.
The units are kelvins per model timestep.
