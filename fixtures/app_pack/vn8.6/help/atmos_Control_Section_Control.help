Pre-compiled section for atmospheric-model control level decks.

This window allows the user to specify which version of the control-level
section for the atmospheric model that they require in their executable. 

This is always required when the atmospheric model is included.

See the UM source code and the Object-Xref file to see which DECKs make up a
section.
